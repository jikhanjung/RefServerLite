# Daily Overview: 2025-07-16

## Summary of Work Performed

Today's session focused on understanding the current state of the RefServerLite project, planning future enhancements, and documenting key development strategies.

### 1. Project State Analysis & Summary
- Reviewed core project documentation (`README.md`, `development_plan/*.md`, `requirements.txt`) to grasp the project's overview, tech stack, and features.
- Provided a concise summary of RefServerLite's current capabilities, including its FastAPI backend, SQLite/ChromaDB usage, PDF processing (OCR, metadata, embeddings), and web interface.

### 2. Future Feature Planning
- Proposed several potential new features categorized into UX/UI improvements, core functionality enhancements (e.g., LLM-based metadata extraction, advanced embedding strategies), and management/scalability.

### 3. Advanced Semantic Chunking Strategy
- Engaged in a detailed discussion regarding the limitations of page-level chunking and the benefits of semantic chunking.
- Developed a comprehensive, multi-phase implementation plan for adding a new, structure-aware semantic chunking pipeline. This plan includes:
    - **Phase 0:** Prerequisite for structured text extraction (handling both text-layered and OCR-based PDFs).
    - **Phase 1:** Implementation of a hierarchical chunking module (`app/chunking.py`) using recursive character splitting.
    - **Phase 2:** Database schema update (`app/models.py`) to store semantic chunk metadata.
    - **Phase 3:** Implementation of embedding and storage logic for semantic chunks (`app/embedding.py`, `app/db.py`).
    - **Phase 4:** Integration of the new pipeline into the main document processing flow (`app/pipeline.py`) as a non-blocking step.
    - **Phase 5:** Database migration process (user-driven).
- This plan was documented in `devlog/20250716_002_advanced_chunking_strategy_plan.md`.

### 4. Embedding Visualization Experiments
- Formulated a detailed plan for a series of experiments to analyze and improve the visual representation of document/page embeddings (fingerprints).
- The plan includes:
    - **Experiment 1:** Analyzing fingerprint sensitivity to different text extraction methods (digital, standard OCR, low-quality OCR).
    - **Experiment 2:** Comparing intra-document vs. inter-document page fingerprints.
    - **Experiment 3:** Evaluating the effectiveness of 3D visualization techniques (bar charts, surface plots) versus 2D heatmaps, with a critical assessment of static vs. interactive 3D.
    - **Experiment 4:** Investigating visual contrast enhancement techniques (linear normalization, histogram equalization, sigmoid function) for faint fingerprints.
- The current color mapping for 2D heatmaps (-1=blue, +1=red, 0=white) was noted and incorporated into the plan.
- The plan was documented in `devlog/20250716_003_embedding_visualization_experiments_plan.md`.

### 5. Documentation & File Management
- Updated `GEMINI.md` to reflect the project's specific database migration workflow, clarifying that the agent's role is planning, and Claude Code handles implementation.
- Moved and renamed the semantic chunking plan file to align with the `devlog` directory's naming convention.

## Next Steps

- The detailed plans for semantic chunking and embedding visualization experiments are now ready for Claude Code to proceed with implementation. The agent's role for these tasks is complete.
